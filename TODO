TODO for Mustache PHP Compiler
------------------------------

X evaluate lambda result
X fix recursive partials
X lambda results should parse with the current delimiters (only when in section)
X coalesce statics that follow each other
X fix recognition of non empty lines
X implement specification testing
X add partial indentation
X fix partial recursion context stack
X lambda should receive the raw string -> store pos in source, add source at beginning of compile

- store current context in context stack for lambdas
- cache compiled partials
- implement view classes
- implement different compiler options (enable/disable lambdas for example)
- speed up context lookup
- add option to directly include partials into code of calling template
