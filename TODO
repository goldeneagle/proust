TODO for Mustache PHP Compiler
------------------------------

X evaluate lambda result
X fix recursive partials
X lambda results should parse with the current delimiters (only when in section)
X coalesce statics that follow each other
X fix recognition of non empty lines
X implement specification testing

- fix partial recursion context stack
- lambda should receive the raw string -> store pos in source, add source at beginning of compile
- store current context in context stack for lambdas

- add partial indentation

- cache compiled partials
- implement view classes
- implement different compiler options (enable/disable lambdas for example)
- speed up context lookup
- add option to directly include partials into code of calling template
